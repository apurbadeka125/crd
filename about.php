Of A.H. & Vety, Govt of Assam. After working almost three year of time ,he had resigned his Government job in September 1991 and joined a national level funding & supporting organization namely Rashtryia Gramin Vikas Nidhi(RGVN). Yet Dr Sarmah was passionate with his own idea of doing something innovation and time worthy, that leads to share his vision and plan with a few professionals and entrepreneurs in 1994. His idea was well-supported and finally a consensus plan was  emerged and culminated in forming Centre for Rural Development(CRD). Initially area livelihood promotion & enhancement based on local skill and resources. Later the organization got registered under the FCRA and various donor and funding agencies come forward to support CRD for bringing it mission into reality.</p>
