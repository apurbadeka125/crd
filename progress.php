            <p>During the financial year April 2014-March2015, Rickshaw Bank has outreached 463nos.of poor and marginalized people in different places in Assam.</p>
            <p>Apart from physical outreached, the organization has worked quite a lot with the member and grass –root staff to enhance the operational framework of the project especially on social aspect. This is done to fortify the solidarity of the members and thereby, facilitating the linkage of mainstream institution .Besides, a reflective study was also made to understand the effect of the project over the member’s live hood.</p>

            <h1 class="display-6 font-weight-bold">Progress In Agriculture</h1>
            <p>Assam is predominantly rural and the economy primarily agrarian in nature with almost 70% of the population directly dependent on Agriculture as a source of income. However, the scenario in terms of productivity and production has been mixed. Though we have achieved self sufficiency in rice, the staple crop, fruits & vegetables, we still have a shortfall in overall requirement of oilseed, pulses and potato etc.</p>

                        <p>The AACP is trying to diversify the agriculture through irrigation to increase cropping intensity and thereby to increase net income of the farmers. It emphasizes on participation of farmers in planning, implementation, monitoring and post management through Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA) model and orientation of extension towards lead marketing.</p>

                        <p>As a whole, the programme targets to achieve a sustainable agricultural growth in Assam. In Assam a major part of the cultivable land is cultivated for one time in the whole year only because of poor irrigation system. In order to treat this setback, AACP has mainly put its interest for irrigation component.</p>
                        <p>As outcome, it is observed that the production of Irrigated or Boro paddy is many times high than the production of rain fed paddy. For the irrigation system the project has given a share of 50% costs of the Shallow Tubes Wells (STWs), Low Lift Pumps (LLP) to the economically poor farmers so that they also can afford irrigation facilities in their paddy field.

                        <p>For operational convenience, the whole Kamrup district is divided in to three divisions i.e. Guwahati, Rangia and Boko. During this period, the project has also provided pump sets by contributing 50 % of its total costs. Apart from the above activities, CRD has helped the farmers by giving them necessary information regarding quality seeds & other planting materials, improved method of crop production, linkage with other schemes under AACP, linkage with banks for KCC etc.

            <p>Pisciculture is recognized as the sunshine which contributes substantially to the overall agricultural economy of the country. It stimulates growth of numbers of subsidiary industries and is the source of livelihood for a large section of economically backward population, especially fishermen and other underprivileged communities. It helps in increasing food supply, generating adequate employment opportunities and raising nutritional level. It has also the huge export potential and is a big source of foreign exchange earnings for the country. However, fishery is basically a state subject and the primary responsibility for its development mainly rests with the state government.</p>

                        <p>The major thrust in fisheries development has been focused on optimizing production and productivity, augmenting export of fishery products; generating employment and improving welfare of fishermen and their socio economic status. Over the years, the fisheries industry is emerging and rapidly growing.</p>
                        <p>There exists several investment opportunities in the sector for the entrepreneurs and farmers. But there are several challenges and issues facing the fisheries development in Assam such as accurate data on assessment of fishery resources and their potential in terms of fish production; development of sustainable technologies, post-harvest storage & transportation, processing etc. However, fishery is having a large market in the Assam and other states in northeastern region including neighboring states West Bengal and Orissa.</p>
                        <p>While focusing on intensive fish production and poverty alleviation, AACP has taken different schemes for fishery development in Assam viz. Farmers’ Pond development, Community Tank Development and Beel Development. In each of the scheme, inclusion of poor and marginalized ones and intensification of productivity are the prime movers</p>
                        <p>In the social mobilization process facilitated by CRD, beneficiaries are selected through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and management groups or committees are formed as per concern of the scheme. It is noteworthy that the community groups have been involved in every step of implementation- estimating expenditure, input management, water quality management, harvesting etc. Besides, CRD has been facilitating institutional development of those common interest groups and committees for long-term sustenance through different skill development programmes like envisioning goal and articulating operational strategy, record-keeping and accounts, developing group dynamics etc. During the year 2009-2010 the fishery sector has brought a significant success. Those fish farmers earlier who did not pay attention to their asset now become aware by this project and earned profit in substantial way.</p>
                        <p>The following table will show the exact progress in the last year including harvest and profit of the farmers.</p>

                    <p>NARMIL (Natural Resource Management and Integrated Livelihood), a new and integrated approach for community based rural development and natural resource conservation would be tasted involving demand-driven integrated micro planning to develop community livelihood opportunities in both forest and non forest activities and improve linkage between forest communities and market for non timber forest products.</p>
                    <p>The concept of Joint Forest Management Committee (JFMC) Participatory Forest Management was initiated in the year 2005 under World Bank funded titled Natural Resource Management and Integrated livelihood (NaRMIL). In Kamrup district 6 JFMC were restructured and nurtured with the object improving sustainable livelihood of the communities through integrated approach of rural development and natural resource conversation in forest fringe communities within the broader framework of AACP through participatory planning implementation and monitoring.</p>
                    <p>The AACP had started to work with the concept of joint forest management since 2005 with 6 JFMCs and on 2008 the number of JFMC was 8 nos. in Kamrup district but on seeing the progress of the project the ARIAS society has increased 2 more JFMCs in 2009. Therefore in 2009 CRD started with two new JFMCs viz. Pokapam-Bogaline JFMC in the Loharghat Range of Kamrup West Division and Dewan Beel JFMC in the Kulsi range of Kamrup West Division. The both JFMC started their plantation works during June-August during this financial period.</p>

                                <p>Apart from the above activities in the project there is another effect that has been observed in the locality of the project areas. Once before implementation of the project the people had a fear to speak in public. But after the intervention of the NGOs in the grass root level they have got a number of information on income generating activities and various government schemes. Besides these, the reserved area inhabitants have been well trained on various income generating activities such as bee keeping, rearing of pig, food processing etc. This has enabled the villagers to gain confidence and come forward for conducting different developmental activities. The development of their village infrastructure is worth mentioning. As entry point activity the project renovated the village roads up to four kilometres, built community hall for arranging meeting and cultural programmes, prepared people’s nursery through which the locals has been benefited by selling the saplings.</p>

                                <p>AACP has formed 39 numbers of DCS in Kamrup district in between 2005 to 2009. During 09-10 field coordinators linked up the members of the DCS to Central Dairy and other milk processing and dairy units for better price and continuous market channel. However the problems in the rural areas of Assam is that the road communication is very poor and there are some areas where the milk producers cannot access the artificial insemination service though they have interest for high yielding cows. It is true that after formation of the DCS the members of DCS and the neighbouring milk producers got lot of technical knowledge on quality control, clean milk production and maintenance of the cowshed. CRD has also formed one Women DCS. It is one of the successful cooperative societies in Assam and the members have linked up with other departments and bank for enhancing their economic activities in the long run.</p>
