            <p>A ray of hope for thousand of poor and toiling human.</p>
            <p>In the technology – driven world of Indians most populous city, one would have expected rickshaws to disappear with the faster growth of modern, motorized transport. Instead, the number of rickshaw have increased amazingly in the last couple of year. In the absence of any substitute mode of transport for short distance, the rickshaw meet the need for urban and sub-urban mobility in middle and lower middle income neighborhood; and provide a low-cost way to transport households goods and furniture. This has also the signifinces in the present day environment where we are talking about global warming and climate changes; and the cycle rickshaw becomes only the green mode of transportation by its very nature of avoiding carbon emission.</p>

            <p>It is estimated that there are 8 million rickshaw puller in India. However, hardly 10% rickshaw pullers own their rickshaw and the rest depend on the private owner on daily rental basis Rs.30 to Rs. 50 vary from place to place. Neither have they had social security nor dignity at their work. The Richwak Bank of CRD has brought a hope to the rickshaw puller by providing a newly designed rickshaw, with insurances and license at an affordable cost with facilitating their solidarity for right and livelihood. The pilot phase of the Rickshaw bank was launched in Guwahati and later it was expanded to the other areas in Assam and outside Assam too. The project was started with much hype on November 20, 2004 and over the six year of period, it has emerged itself as the flagship project of CRD. As on date CRD is the only organization in the world which has exclusively focusing on different development issues of the rickshaw puller and working continually with its rickshaw bank Project.</p>

                    <p>In order to give an impetus to the existing operation of the Rickshaw Bank project, CRD has organized several in house workshops. These are meant to relay the past activities, reflect their learning and give ways for further development. In the workshop, discussion was held on technical as well as social aspects of the project. Finally, a model guideline is prepared for enabling the staff to boosts up the operator.</p>

                                <p>In social aspects, emphasis has been given upon the homogenous group formation based on the original home place, existing dwelling locality in city /town, age-group and caste. However it is very difficult to maintain caste-based, income based homogently and affinity based groups in big city like Guwahati as therein people from different states, district come in search of live hood. In small towns like Nalbari, Mirza; these kind of homogeneity is observed and accordingly the rickshaw puller were encouraged to from groups.</p>
                                <p> Besides, changes have been brought to the earlier concept of “garage” that comprises 5 group of 25 rickshaw puller All the puller under a garage form the general association of the rickshaw puller in a locality within the city. Town .This is direct interface between rickshaw puller and branch coordinator and /or above position at garage level. Steps have been taken for promotion of Rickshaw Puller Cooperative Socitey.The people at CRD and members of the project are positive that a few added features to the operational framework would ensure the implementation of the project with enabling approach of development rather than service delivery method.</p>
